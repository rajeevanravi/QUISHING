# QR Security Research — Awareness & Mitigation

> **WARNING:** This repository contains **research notes, high-level findings, and mitigation strategies** related to QR-code based phishing techniques. It **does not** contain exploit code, operational tooling, or step-by-step instructions that could be used for malicious activity.

## Purpose
This project documents independent security research into how QR codes can be abused in phishing contexts, and — more importantly — how defenders and users can detect and mitigate these threats. The goal is to increase awareness and improve defensive controls, not to enable abuse.

## What’s included
- High-level research summary and threat model.
- Summary of findings and measurement results (aggregated/non-actionable).
- Defensive recommendations for users, security teams, and product owners.
- Suggested detection heuristics and incident response checklist (non-actionable).
- Links to public academic papers and best practices.

## What’s intentionally excluded
- Any operational exploit code, phishing landing pages, automated toolchains, or step-by-step attack recipes.
- Payloads, templates, or scripts that enable live phishing campaigns.

## Responsible use & ethics
- This repository is strictly for **defensive**, **educational**, and **research** purposes.
- Do **not** use this material to attempt unauthorized access, social-engineering, or real-world phishing.
- If you are performing active testing, always obtain explicit written permission from the system owner and operate in an isolated lab environment with test accounts.

## Safe reproduction (high level)
If you want to reproduce experiments for defensive testing:
1. Use an isolated lab (air-gapped or otherwise segregated from production).
2. Use test accounts and domains that you control.
3. Do not send unsolicited or live phishing messages to real users.
4. Keep all test artifacts confined to the lab and delete them after testing.

## Defensive recommendations (summary)
- Treat QR codes like links — educate users to preview the destination before visiting.
- Implement URL inspection and blocklists at gateway/proxy level.
- Use content security policies and email/sms filtering to limit redirect chains.
- Monitor for unusual domain registrations and rapid redirect patterns.
- Provide clear reporting channels so users can report suspicious QR codes or messages.

## Responsible disclosure
If you discover a vulnerability in a third-party product during your research:
- Contact the vendor's security team privately and follow their disclosure process.
- Give the vendor a reasonable timeframe to respond and fix the issue before public disclosure.
- If you cannot contact the vendor, consider coordinated disclosure through a recognized coordinator (e.g., CERT) or a bug-bounty platform that supports disclosure.

# How to Perform (For Education Purposes Only)

> **WARNING:** This repository is for **educational and defensive** research only.
> It **does not** contain exploit code or step-by-step instructions that could be used
> to capture credentials, attack real systems, or target real people. Do not use these
> materials for malicious purposes.

## Overview
This document shows a **safe, non-operational** workflow for studying user interaction with QR codes and login-page mockups in an isolated lab environment. All experiments must use test accounts and synthetic data only, and must have written authorization from the system owner or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval where applicable.

## High-level (Safe) Steps

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine or lab environment.
2. **Choose a platform UI to study** — for research purposes, capture the *visual aspects only* (use a saved copy of the page for mockup or recreate the visual elements). Do **not** use or impersonate live production sites or real organizations.
3. **Rename the local file** to `index.html` for easy local viewing if needed.
4. **Replace the template**: if there is a `template` folder with an `index.html`, replace it with your mockup `index.html`. Ensure the mockup is strictly client-side and does not submit data to any server.
5. **Open your `index.html` locally** in a browser to verify the visual appearance.
6. **Use example input fields** for visual mockups only:
   ```html
   <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" required><br>
   <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" required><br>

7. Use a client-side-only form for mock interactions (example: action="#" and prevent default submission). Simulate success client-side; do not store credentials.
   Start a local development server in an isolated lab environment to serve the mock pages.
8. If you need to access the mock site from another machine in the lab, use a private, internal network or a lab-only tunnel; do **not** expose the service to the public Internet.(use public tunning)
9. Use the QR.py script that links to the local mock page for testing purposes only. The generator should produce harmless images that point to lab-controlled, non-production URLs.
10. When prompted for a URL during testing, provide a lab-only URL that you control. Do not provide any public or third-party URLs.
11. The generated QR code is for internal, consented testing only. Do **not** distribute it to unsuspecting people.
12. Only share the mock QR code with consenting participants in a controlled study or with your security team during an internal exercise.
13. If a consenting participant interacts with the mock page, simulate a harmless success response client-side (for example, show an informational message or a small game) and record only non-sensitive metrics (clicks, timings, survey answers). Under no circumstances should actual credentials or personally identifiable information be collected or stored.
